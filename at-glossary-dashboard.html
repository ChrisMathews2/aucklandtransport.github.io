                term: "Acquiring Authority",
                definition: "When AT seeks to acquire land for a public project (such as roads or transport infrastructure), AT first attempts to reach a voluntary agreement with the landowner. This involves negotiations where both parties agree on a price and terms for the sale of the land.\n\nIf an agreement cannot be reached between AT and the landowner, Auckland Council, as the acquiring authority under the Public Works Act 1981, can initiate compulsory acquisition. This legal process allows the Council to acquire the land without the landowner's consent, subject to specific legal procedures. The landowner can still object, and compensation is provided, typically at market value. Compulsory acquisition is often considered a last resort and occurs when the land is essential for public works and negotiations have failed.",

                definition: "Transportation modes include walking, cycling, jogging, and the use of small-wheeled transport such as skates, skateboards, push scooters, and wheelchair travel.\n\nActive modes are predominantly used for short local trips (up to 2km for walking and 10km for cycling) and, particularly walking, are also the primary form of access/egress for public transport trips at most locations.\n\nActive modes can help reduce congestion, improve network productivity, reduce transport-related emissions and improve public health. The Active Modes team sits with the PT team at AT to plan, prioritise and secure funding for improving walking and cycling infrastructure, to work with targeted trip attractors (schools, tertiary education, PT interchanges, workplaces and community groups) to promote and enable safe and sustainable travel behaviour and to provide customers with information about active modes networks and services. One of the prime objectives of the directorate is to increase the proportion of active modes and public transport journeys as Auckland grows.",

The first leg is at the beginning of the journey, where customers get from their origin to their first PT stop. The last leg is between the last PT stop and the final destination. The first and last leg are usually by active modes such as walking, cycling or micro-mobility. Many PT facilities incorporate secure cycle storage and drop off zone for scooter and ebike share, to improve the connection between modes.\n\nOn-Demand Services\n\nThe legs can include on-demand services which are a form of transport where vehicles adapt their routes, stops and timetables according to customers' needs, rather than using a fixed route or timetable.\n\nDirect On-Demand Services\n\nAT's direct involvement in on-demand transport includes the AT Local service, which is currently operating in South Auckland. This is a publicly subsidised, app-based rideshare service that uses dynamic routing to connect people with the broader PT network, particularly useful for first and last leg travel. AT Local is operated by contracted commercial providers, as AT does not (and can not) currently own its own vehicles. It is similar in function to rideshare services like Uber, but is designed to support PT access and affordability. On-demand services like AT Local are typically considered in the following situations:\n\n- Complementing existing PT -- providing new first/last leg connections to frequent services;\n\n- Supplementing service gaps -- extending PT access to areas with no existing coverage or low demand outside of peak hours;\n\n- Replacing underperforming routes -- offering a better customer experience and improved value for money in areas where fixed routes are inefficient.\n\nIndirect On-Demand Services\n\nAT also plays a regulatory or enabling role in other forms of on-demand and shared transport. This includes licensing private operators of e-scooters, as well as potential support for services like bike sharing and carpooling. While AT doesn't run these services directly, they form part of the broader first and last leg ecosystem.\n\nPrivate operators provide transport services that complement the public transport network, offering more flexible options for completing journeys efficiently. Key operators include:\n\n- Car-sharing providers like Cityhop and Mevo, offering short-term vehicle rentals. Auckland Transport sometimes oversees the parking area where these vehicles are located. For example no charges on metered parking\n\n- Carpooling providers such as POOLIT and MISH\n\n- Ride-sharing services like UberPool\n\n- E-scooter providers like Lime and Beam.",
